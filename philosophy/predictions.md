I'm reminded of Victor Niederhoffer's book _The Education of a Speculator_.

> What, then, is the lesson of the Delphi?  Oracles, forecasts, and prophecies are a business. They should be evaluated with the same skepticism and savvy that would be applied to a used-car dealership or an Oriental rug auction. Legendary and self-administered reports of forecast accuracy should be taken with eight grains of salt.  At Delphi, the sacred rituals, the architecture, and the very vista inspired a belief in accuracy.  The art, athletic games, feasts, religious sanctuary, and networking helped attract visitors.  The dignity, ambiguity, and caution of the predictions were cover propaganda designed to diffuse evaluation.
