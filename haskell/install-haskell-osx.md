I started out with `brew install haskell-stack`. I guess I got this from an Atom ide-haskell site that listed dependencies for that editor plugin.

I wanted to follow along with a book and found that `ghci` wasn't installed.  After a little searching, I ran `brew cask install haskell-platform`.  (I didn't uninstall the other version first.)
