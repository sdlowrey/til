# Algorithmic Complexity

## Dominance Relations

We say that a faster-growing function _dominates_ a slower-growing one [1]. In order of increasing dominance:

- _O(1)_ constant
- _O(log n)_ logarithmic
- _O(n)_ linear
- _O(n log n)_ superlinear, linearithmic, quasilinear
- _O(n^2)_ quadratic
- _O(c^n)_ exponential
- _O(n!)_ factorial

There are many other common time complexities [2] but these are enough to reason with.
